## Introduction
This project aims to classify images into different categories using SVM. The SVM algorithm is a powerful supervised learning model used for classification and regression tasks.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hash-walker/AI_351_SVM_image_classification.git
cd AI_351_SVM_image_classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the model and classify images, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the `train.py` script.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should be placed in the `data` directory. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and split into training and testing sets.

## Results
The results of the image classification will be saved in the `results` directory. You can find the accuracy, confusion matrix, and other evaluation metrics in this directory.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
